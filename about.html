                    Hello,
                 </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Peter Curtiss, an industrial designer and creative based out of Brooklyn. After graduing magna cum laude from the University of Colorado Boulder Environmental Design program, I moved to New York in 2022 to persue a career in industrial design.
                    <p>
                    Working both independently and as a contract design specialist, I have continuously provided my clients and employers with exceptional design solutions, videos, animations, and promotional materials. 
                </p>
                 <p>
                    I particularly pride myself on the breadth of my skill set, being adept at several CAD programs, rendering, graphic design, photo manipulation, motion graphics, video production, 3D animation, prototyping, electronics, AI usage, fabrication, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of December 2023, I am currently available for new employment opportunities.
                </p>
